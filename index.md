    # Hi, I'm Shazia! Welcome to My Space 👋

    I'm a researcher, tech enthusiast, and someone who’s always been curious about how things work.  
    Right now, I’m doing my Ph.D. at Australian Catholic University in North Sydney, where I focus on making AI systems — especially large language models — more reliable and trustworthy for healthcare.

    I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, NLP, and how technology can make people’s lives better.
